This repo consists of the lex and yacc files that are required to design a cpp compiler.
The files generate 
1) The symbol table 
2) The intermediate code generation 
3) Optimization 
      --> Dead Code Elimination
      --> Constant Folding
      --> Constant Propogation
      --> Common Sub-Expression Elimination
